            Was foundedÂ in 2006, being the FIRST SURF SCHOOL OF VILAMOURA BEACH,
            ALGARVE. Our school is certified by the Portuguese Surfing
            Federation and by Turismo de Portugal. The School aims to teach the
            art of surfing the waves in a safe, correct and relaxed way, always
            under the close and attentive supervision of teachers. Thousands of
            people have already learned from us to slide on the wave wall on top
            of a board.

            We have facilities that allow our students to equip themselves and
            keep their belongings safe and at the end of the class they have a
            warm shower at their disposal. We have a wide variety of safe boards
            (softboards) and modern wetsuits to teach in a safe and fun way. The
            heads of the School are trained by the Faculty, experienced and
            accredited by the Portuguese Surf Federation. The School is open
            everyday of the year, including weekends and holidays. Hours vary
            depending on tides and sea conditions.
